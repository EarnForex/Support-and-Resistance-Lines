# Support and Resistance Lines

Support and Resistance Lines is a custom MT4/MT5 indicator coded by EarnForex.com. The indicator is based on the standard Fractals and ATR (Average True Range) indicators. It shows horizontal support and resistance lines and zones directly on the chart.

Support and Resistance Lines will issue alerts when price gets either into a 'danger' zone (too close to an S/R level) or into a 'safe' zone (far enough from an S/R level).
